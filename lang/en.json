I use different technologies, but most often in my projects I use the <strong>Laravel+Vue</strong> combination. <br> My team includes <strong>designers and SEO specialists</strong>. This way we can cover the entire life cycle of a website, from design from scratch to bringing the site to the TOP 10 search platforms. In addition to freelancing, I now work at <strong>Tinkoff Bank</strong> and am interested in drums.",
